oTree Studio
============

`oTree Studio <https://www.otreehub.com/studio/>`__
is a new point-and-click interface for creating oTree projects.

If you are new to oTree,
we suggest starting with oTree Studio, because you can get started building
oTree apps without knowing Python.
At any point you can download the code of your project and switch to using the Python-based
version of oTree.

When you use oTree Studio, you design your app in the visual interface.
Whenever you want to test your app, you can download your .otreezip file.
oTree Studio has instructions on how to set up oTree on your computer so it automatically
detects newly downloaded .otreezip files and runs them.
