Part 0: Simple survey (for PyCharm users)
=========================================

Let's create a simple survey -- on the first page, we ask the participant
for their name and age, then on the next page, display this info back to them.

Upgrade oTree
-------------

To ensure you are using the latest version of oTree, open your command window and run::

    pip3 install -U otree

Create the app
--------------

Use your command line to ``cd`` to the oTree project folder you created,
which contains ``requirements_base.txt``. Assuming you named the folder ``oTree``,
you would do::

    cd oTree

Then, create the app::

    otree startapp my_simple_survey

Then in PyCharm, go to the folder ``my_simple_survey`` that was created.

Define models.py
----------------

Open ``models.py`` and scroll to the line that says ``class Player(BasePlayer):``.
Here we define the columns for the Player table in the database.
Let's add 2 fields:

-   ``name`` (which is a ``StringField``, meaning text characters)
-   ``age`` (which is a positive integer field)

.. code-block:: python

    class Player(BasePlayer):
        name = models.StringField()
        age = models.IntegerField()


Define the template
-------------------

This survey has 2 pages:

-  Page 1: players enter their name and age
-  Page 2: players see the data they entered on the previous page

So, let's make 2 HTML template files.
Next to your ``models.py`` you will find a folder called ``templates/``,
which in turn has another subfolder called ``my_simple_survey``.
Put your templates there.

Let's name the first page ``MyPage.html``, and put these contents inside:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% extends "global/Page.html" %}
    {% load otree %}

    {% block title %}
        Enter your information
    {% endblock %}

    {% block content %}

        Please enter the following information.

        {% formfields %}

        {% next_button %}

    {% endblock %}

The second template will be called ``Results.html``.

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% extends "global/Page.html" %}
    {% load otree %}

    {% block title %}
        Results
    {% endblock %}

    {% block content %}

        <p>Your name is {{ player.name }} and your age is {{ player.age }}.</p>

        {% next_button %}
    {% endblock %}


Define pages.py
---------------

Now we define our pages, which contain the logic for how to display the
HTML templates.

Since we have 2 templates, we need 2 ``Page`` classes in ``pages.py``.
The names should match those of the templates (``MyPage`` and
``Results``).

First let's define ``MyPage``. This page contains a form, so
we need to define ``form_model`` and ``form_fields``.

.. code-block:: python

    class MyPage(Page):
        form_model = 'player'
        form_fields = ['name', 'age']

Now we define ``Results``. This page doesn't have a form or any other
special attributes, so we just write "pass".

.. code-block:: python

    class Results(Page):
        pass

If ``pages.py`` already has a ``WaitPage``, you can delete that,
because WaitPages are only necessary for multi-player games.

Then, set your ``page_sequence`` to ``MyPage`` followed by ``Results``.
So, all in all, ``pages.py`` should contain this:

.. code-block:: python

    from otree.api import Currency as c, currency_range
    from ._builtin import Page, WaitPage
    from .models import Constants


    class MyPage(Page):
        form_model = 'player'
        form_fields = ['name', 'age']


    class Results(Page):
        pass


    page_sequence = [
        MyPage,
        Results
    ]


Define the session config in settings.py
----------------------------------------

Now we go to ``settings.py`` in the project's top folder and add an entry to ``SESSION_CONFIGS``.

.. code-block:: python

    SESSION_CONFIGS = [
        dict(
            name='my_simple_survey',
            num_demo_participants=3,
            app_sequence=['my_simple_survey']
        ),
    ]


Start the server
----------------

Enter::

    otree devserver

Then open your browser to ``http://localhost:8000`` to try out the survey.


Fix any errors
--------------

If there is an error in your code, the command line will display a "traceback"
(error message) that is formatted something like this::

    C:\oTree\chris> otree devserver
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "C:\oTree\chris\manage.py", line 10, in <module>
        execute_from_command_line(sys.argv, script_file=__file__)
      File "c:\otree\core\otree\management\cli.py", line 170, in execute_from_command_line
        utility.execute()
      File "C:\oTree\venv\lib\site-packages\django\core\management\__init__.py", line 328, in execute
        django.setup()
      File "C:\oTree\venv\lib\site-packages\django\__init__.py", line 18, in setup
        apps.populate(settings.INSTALLED_APPS)
      File "C:\oTree\venv\lib\site-packages\django\apps\registry.py", line 108, in populate
        app_config.import_models(all_models)
      File "C:\oTree\venv\lib\site-packages\django\apps\config.py", line 198, in import_models
        self.models_module = import_module(models_module_name)
      File "C:\Python27\Lib\importlib\__init__.py", line 37, in import_module
        __import__(name)
      File "C:\oTree\chris\public_goods_simple\models.py", line 40
        self.total_contribution = sum([p.contribution for p in self.get_players()])
           ^
    IndentationError: expected an indented block

It's called a "traceback" because it traces the error down through the chain
of code. Your first step should be to look at the last lines of the message.
Specifically, find the file and line number of the last entry.
In the above example, it's ``"C:\oTree\chris\public_goods_simple\models.py", line 40``.
So, go to that file & line number.
Look for the problem mentioned at the last line of the traceback.
In this example, it is ``IndentationError: expected an indented block``
(which indicates that the problem has to do with code indentation).
Try to fix the error then run the command again.

Sometimes the last line of the traceback refers to a file that is not part of your code.
For example, in the below traceback, the last line refers to ``/site-packages/easymoney.py``,
which is not part of my app, but rather an external package::

    Traceback:

In these situations, look to see if any of your code is contained in the traceback.
Above we can see that the traceback goes through the file ``/Users/chris/oTree/public_goods/pages.py``,
which is part of my project. The bug is on line 108, as indicated.

If you can't figure out the cause of the error,
you can ask a question on the oTree
`discussion group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/otree>`__.
