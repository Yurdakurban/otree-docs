Version history
```````````````

For each version below, this page lists that version's most important changes,
or any minor changes that I considered important to know about when upgrading.

Version 2.2
===========

-   support for the ``otreezip`` format
    (``otree zip``, ``otree unzip``, ``otree runzip``)
-   MTurk: in sandbox mode, don't grant qualifications
    or check qualification requirements
-   MTurk: before paying participants, check if there is adequate
    account balance.
-   "next button" is disabled after clicking, to prevent congesting the server
    with duplicate page loads.
-   Upgrade to the latest version of Sentry
-   Form validation methods should go on the model, not the page.
    See :ref:`dynamic_validation`
-   :ref:`app_after_this_page`
-   Various performance and stability improvements

.. _v21:

Version 2.1
===========

-   oTree now raises an error if you use an undefined variable in your template.
    This will help catch typos like
    ``{{ Player.payoff }}`` or ``{% if player.id_in_gruop %}``.
    This means that apps that previously worked may now get a template error
    (previously, it failed silently).
    If you can't remove the offending variable,
    you can apply the ``|default`` filter, like: ``{{ my_undefined_variable|default:None }}``
-   oTree now warns you if you use an invalid attribute on a Page/WaitPage.
    You can disable this by setting ``_allow_custom_attributes=True`` on the page class.
    See `here <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/otree/_yzlaTMfJKs>`__
    for more details.
-   CSV/Excel data export is done asynchronously, which will fix
    timeout issues for large files on Heroku.
-   Better performance, especially for "Monitor" and "Data" tab in admin interface


Version 2.0
===========

See :ref:`v20`.


.. _v14:

Version 1.4
===========

Here are the main changes in 1.4:

-   MTurk: improved stability, and upgrade from boto2 to boto3.

    or dropped out. See :ref:`group_by_arrival_time`.
-   Upgrade timeout JavaScript library (jQuery countdown)

To install, run this::

    pip3 install -U otree-core
    otree resetdb


.. _v13:

Version 1.3
===========

Here are the main changes in 1.3:

-   ``get_timeout_seconds`` lets you set timeouts dynamically,
    and create timeouts that span multiple pages or rounds. See :ref:`get_timeout_seconds`.
-   ``get_players_for_group`` lets you control how ``group_by_arrival_time``
    assigns players to groups. See :ref:`get_players_for_group`
-   Bots: you can now simulate & test a page timeout. See :ref:`bot_timeout`.
-   ``DEMO_PAGE_TITLE`` setting added. See :ref:`DEMO_PAGE_TITLE`.

To install, run this::

    pip3 install -U otree-core
    otree resetdb

.. _v12:

Version 1.2
===========

-   If a page is submitted automatically by a timeout,
    oTree will attempt to save the incomplete form.
    See :ref:`timeout_form`
-   The :ref:`|json <json>` filter was added, as an alternative to ``safe_json``.

Version 1.0
===========

Here are the main changes in 1.0:

    (modifying ``SESSION_CONFIGS`` parameters without changing the source code).
    See :ref:`edit_config`.
-   Performance improvements
-   The default for the ``payoff`` field is now ``0``, not ``None``.
    (Make sure your code doesn't rely on ``payoff`` being ``None``.)

See the notes :ref:`here <bots>`.
